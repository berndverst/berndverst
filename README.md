### Hi, I'm Bernd ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Developer Advocate, Software Engineer and Product Manager passionate about making developer tooling and products more intuitive for new users and seasoned experts alike. I also enjoy working on products that connect people or free up time for the things that truly matter. I like mentoring folks of all ages and backgrounds transitioning to the technology industry.

In terms of technology I mostly work with Python, Java, Docker, Kubernetes and a variety of cloud services. I am a contributor to [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org) and blog occassionally at https://bernd.dev and https://dev.to/berndverst.

As a member of the Microsoft Cloud & AI Developer Relations team I focus on a variety of Azure cloud services. As such you an also find me contributing to various sample apps and documentation in the [Micosoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [MicrosoftDocs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [Azure-Samples](https://github.com/azure-samples) and other GitHub orgs.
