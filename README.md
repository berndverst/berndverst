### Hi, I'm Bernd ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer, Product Manager and Developer Advoacate passionate about making developer tooling and products more intuitive for new users and seasoned experts alike. I also enjoy working on products that connect people or free up time for the things that truly matter. I like mentoring folks of all ages and backgrounds transitioning to the technology industry.

In terms of technology I mostly work with Python, Go, Java, Docker, Kubernetes and a variety of cloud services. I am a contributor to [Dapr](https://dapr.io) and blog occassionally at https://bernd.dev.

I spend a lot of time thinking about open source approaches to cloud and developer infrastructure and tooling.
